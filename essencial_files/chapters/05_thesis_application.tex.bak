\chapter{Application of the proposed approaches}
\label{chap:5_thesis_application}
This section describes how our approaches proposed in Chapters~\ref{chap:3_text_os_system} and~\ref{chap:4_temporal_os_system} could be deployed in an SR for disinfection tasks. Jaci is an SR built to help the fight against many bacterias and viruses, including the SARS-CoV-2~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}. However, despite its efficiency in disinfecting indoor environments and the ability to explore the unknown environment room autonomously, it is not fully autonomous, and, in some cases, its disinfection process is time-consuming. First, Jaci still requires human assistance to find the room and position it there before disinfection. Second, it either disinfects the whole room or does not disinfect it at all. Although we have not been able to deploy our contributions presented in this thesis to Jaci, we believe they could enhance the robot's autonomy. Hence, Jaci would become an even more complete and fully autonomous service robot.

Before explaining how our contributions can be adapted to the disinfection task carried out by Jaci, in Section~\ref{chap:5_jaci_against_covid} we introduce the SR Jaci and how it performs the disinfection. Next, in Section~\ref{chap:5_env_org} we explain how semantic information about the organisation of the environment can improve Jaci's performance. In detail, we show how the robot can become fully autonomous by guiding itself to the rooms to perform the disinfection, Section~\ref{chap:5_jaci_disinf_room}, and how it can partially disinfect the environment under certain circumstances, Section~\ref{chap:5_jaci_disinf_obj}.

\section{Jaci against COVID-19 and hospital infections}
\label{chap:5_jaci_against_covid}
In the past few years, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has quickly and widely infected several countries, globally threatening human lives~\cite{Zhang2020Challenges}. The high infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 is associated but not exclusively with the virus's characteristic of remaining viable on surfaces for days, as demonstrated by studies~\cite{Kampf2020Persistence,Van2020Aerosol}. Besides, the environment disinfection has been recommended by researchers after they have found the SARS-CoV-2 present on surfaces of hospitals, threatening patients with COVID-19~\cite{Wu2020Environmental, Ong2020Air}. Thus, besides the recommended practices to reduce the spreading of the virus, like facial masks and social distancing, it would be very appropriate to use an effective tool to disinfect environments. In addition, hospitals suffer with bacterial and fungus contamination, leading to high rates of infections. 

According to some studies provided by the research community, ultraviolet type-C (UV-C) irradiation has produced a significant reduction in the incidence of microorganisms~\cite{Anderson2017Enhanced, Marra2018No}. In addition to being a no-touch disinfection method, the UV lights have a wide range of incidence that quickly sanitises the air and nearby surfaces, save water, and are reusable. The combination of all these characteristics make the UV lights a suitable candidate for environment disinfection, and the increasing deployment of these lights in hospital and other health centres supports their effectiveness~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}. In contrast to these convenient characteristics of UV lights, prolonged exposure to them is not safe for humans due to the damage they can cause to the skin and eyes~\cite{Kitagawa2021Effectiveness}.

The SR Jaci comes into play to replace humans in UV-C disinfection tasks and prevent them from getting hurt~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}. Instor\footnote{\url{https://www.instor.com.br}} has projected and built Jaci with eighteen UV-C lights attached to it in a two-layers tower shape, as shown in Figure~\ref{chap:5_fig_jaci_lights_on_front}. Equipped with a 2D lidar and a few cameras (RGB and RGB-D), Jaci aims to navigate through the environment to perform the disinfection autonomously. It moves through free spaces within the environment and next to the border of obstacles, keeping an ideal distance from them and controling its velocity to ensure an uniform disinfection. 

Figure~\ref{chap:5_fig_jaci_lights_on_back} illustrates Jaci disinfecting an operating room, circumventing the operating table and the surgical light. It is necessary to expose the existing microorganisms on obstacle surfaces to UV-C irradiation for a certain time to ensure their inactivation. An ideal UV dose must be delivered to a specific region to consider it sanitized~\cite{Chanprakon2019Ultra, Conte2020Design}. Jaci's autonomous system has been developed by Phi Robotics Research Lab\footnote{\url{https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/phi-group/site}} from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and it is responsible for both computing the disinfection trajectory and the delivered UV-C dose. While Jaci navigates through the free spaces of the environment, it also computes a dose map. This map estimates the amount of UV-C delivered on every part of the map. Hence, the constant update on the dose map helps the robot determine the regions that have already been sanitised and those that have not. Therefore, Jaci is a suitable disinfection tool that prevents humans from getting harmed by long-term UV exposure. Simultaneously, it reduces the spreading of the virus any other microorganism that may exist.

\end{figure}

Although Jaci seems a complete solution to fight viruses and bacterias spreading, there is still room for improvement. Among the changes in Jaci's software, we highlight Jaci's dependency on human aid to find and place it within the room to disinfect, and the lack of object-oriented disinfection. The first change is related to the preparation phase before starting the disinfection. Jaci relies on human assistance to be placed within the room to start the disinfecting process in its current version. On the other hand, the second change is associated with Jaci's performance while performing the disinfection. Nowadays, Jaci only finishes the disinfection when the surface of objects in the free space boundary receives the ideal UV-C dose. It means that Jaci does not distinguish objects, i.e., regardless the objects there are in the environment, all of them will be disinfected. We believe that our contributions presented in this thesis can provide Jaci with the organisational semantic information necessary for these two improvements. Unfortunately, we have not been able to deploy our code to Jaci and carry out some experiments to evaluate the improvements in Jaci's performance. Instor could not make it available for us to use it for a certain time to conduct the experiments, but we still plan in conducting the experiments in the near future. However, based on how our proposal works and the results presented in this thesis, we can discuss how they could be adapted for Jaci's context and explain why they would be helpful.

\section{Jaci and the environment organisation}
\label{chap:5_env_org}
Jaci is an SR that has been proposed to operate in indoor environments. Its efficiency in quickly sanitising environments, mainly due to the high amount of UV-C lights that combined deliver a high UV-C dose per second in a wide area in Jaci's surroundings, allows the robot to be productive~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}. Depending on the arrangement of obstacles in the rooms, Jaci can disinfect many rooms before recharging its battery. 

However, it is necessary to improve its autonomy by addressing the two issues mentioned above to maximise even more its efficiency. In our view, our contributions presented in this thesis, which relies on the organisational semantic information available in the environments where Jaci is supposed to operate, can provide the way for such efficiency improvement. Below we dive deep into how our systems could boost Jaci's efficiency.

\subsection{Disinfecting a specific room}
\label{chap:5_jaci_disinf_room}
Imagine that Jaci is deployed in a large environment, where there are multiple rooms connected to corridors, like the hospital shown in Figure~\ref{chp05_fig:hospital_simulation}. Jaci has a preparation phase before starting its disinfection process in a given room in its present form. As briefly introduced in Section~\ref{chap:5_jaci_against_covid}, it depends on human help to place it within the room, and then it is allowed to perform its task. This dependency is not an issue in small environments where there is just a few rooms to be disinfected, but it is a problem in places with a higher demand for the service provided by Jaci. Besides, this limitation worsens when a sequence of rooms must be sanitised, one right before the other. When Jaci finishes the disinfection in a certain room, it has to wait to be picked up by someone and then brought to the next room. The longer a waiting time between two disinfection processes, the longer it takes to disinfect the last room, and the more inefficient it becomes.   

\begin{figure}

    \caption[Hospital environment used during in simulation during the development of Jaci's autonomous system.]{Hospital environment used during in simulation during the development of Jaci's autonomous system.}
    \label{chp05_fig:hospital_simulation}
\end{figure}

This limitation can be interpreted as an OS. Jaci has to find a particular room that must be disinfected, which is exactly the context of our contribution presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:3_text_os_system}. It could be imported to Jaci as an alternative to such an issue of human dependency. As shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:3_text_os_system}, our NSOS system guides a robot during a search for a specific door label in unknown environments. Analysing how the door labels are locally organised, our system estimates which regions are more promising to contain the target door label. Hence, the robot avoids the less likely regions and focuses on the most likely ones. 

Jaci could autonomously search for the target door label in a human-out-of-the-loop process with our NSOS system. Instead of moving Jaci to the target door label, the person could request Jaci to find and disinfect it. Jaci may take more time to find the target than if a human would move it in the first few requests. However, as our NSOS system also builds the environment map while searching for the target, the more Jaci searches for different door labels, the more it explores (and maps) the environment. Consequently, it becomes more likely that Jaci does not need to search for every door label, as it discovers many door labels during a search. After a while, the whole environment would be mapped, which means that Jaci would be aware of all door labels. A further improvement could be using a path-planning approach for cases where the target door-label position is already known. Therefore, Jaci relies on a path-planning to compute the optimal path if the target door label has already been recognised and mapped. Otherwise, it relies on our NSOS system from Chapter~\ref{chap:3_text_os_system} to search for the target.

Besides the hospital environment we mentioned before, there are other examples that highlight the improvement in the Jaci's autonomy with our NSOS system. Places that remain closed for a few days in a row, like schools and offices during the weekends and holidays, are perfect scenarios for multiple rooms disinfected in sequence. This is because the lack of people within the buildings reduces the risk of someone getting hurt due to the UV light exposure, and makes all empty rooms ready to be disinfected. Then, with the aid of our NSOS system, a single person could set a list of rooms to be disinfected by Jaci during the days the place is empty. 

%The fact that there are no people that may get hurt

\subsection{Disinfecting a specific object within a room}
\label{chap:5_jaci_disinf_obj}
Jaci's autonomous system developed specifically for the sanitising task guides the robot throughout the free space, maintaining the robot to a certain distance from the obstacle borders. The experiments with Jaci indicate that once the disinfection process has started, it only finishes when the whole room has received the ideal UV-C dose (except for the objects that are positioned in regions that Jaci's lights cannot reach)~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}. In summary, if Jaci can reach a certain region in the environment, it will be disinfected. Although the disinfection of the whole environment is ideal for most cases, Jaci could also offer the possibility of performing partial disinfection of certain objects in the room. For example, Jaci could disinfect the tables and computers more often than the bookshelves when operating in a library. Similarly, in a school, Jaci could disinfect the water dispensers in the hallways right before the break instead of disinfecting all the hallways (including all walls and other obstacles). By focusing on disinfecting only an object (or a list of objects), Jaci would be more effective and efficient in providing a safer and cleaner environment for people in short periods.

However, Jaci does not provide such a high-level disinfection option in its current version due to its purely geometric autonomous system. The map cells are represented only as free, occupied (obstacle), or unknown. Since this type of environment representation does not differentiate obstacles, there is no association between high-level concepts (or object classes) to some map areas. Consequently, Jaci's autonomous system for disinfection is unable to answer any other request other than ``\textit{disinfect the whole environment}''. Besides lacking a high-level representation for objects, there is another issue with object-based disinfection. When Jaci is requested to disinfect a certain object, it needs to know where such a target object is to perform the disinfection. However, it is not appropriate to assume that the target object has already been mapped or that the object will be at the same position all the time. In case the target object has not been mapped or moved from its position, Jaci would have to search for it. 

An alternative to overcome these issues is another contribution of our thesis presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:4_temporal_os_system}, a temporal semantic OS system. Besides providing the high-level representation of the environment, our OS system also performs the OS considering the object organisation over time. Combining our system with Jaci would allow the robot to efficiently search for the object when its position is unknown and perform the local disinfection. Another advantage would be scheduling the disinfection for more convenient periods for every place and situation. Since our semantic OS system is temporal, it can estimate the most likely spot where the target object will be based on previous observations. Lastly, as it is very likely that the environment constantly needs to be disinfected, Jaci will have the opportunity of collecting more data about the objects for our TSOS system. Hence, it is a mutual collaboration between Jaci and our OS system. Jaci gathers more data for the OS system while performing constant disinfection. Simultaneously, our OS system makes Jaci save resources by travelling short distances when searching for the target object. 

\subsection{Summary}
\label{chap:5_jaci_further_discussion}
The deployment of our contributions to Jaci would completely change how the user interacts with it. The current interaction is for a person to move it to the room and request it to start the disinfection process. However, with our first semantic OS system, the user could send a request to Jaci in a high-level form, e.g. ``\textit{disinfect the room number 12, and then the room number 15}''. The inclusion of our second semantic OS system would allow requests at an even higher level, such as ``\textit{disinfect the computer on room 12 at 11:00}''. The difference in the user's request to Jaci reflects the improvement in terms of human-robot interaction and Jaci's autonomy during the disinfection process. Although we were unable to carry out experiments with our contributions deployed to Jaci, their results presented in both Chapters~\ref{chap:3_text_os_system} and~\ref{chap:4_temporal_os_system} suggest the improvements that Jaci could achieve. The semantic information inferred from the organisation of the environment could bridge the gap between Jaci's purely geometric autonomous disinfection system and its improved high-level version. Judging by the characteristics of this thesis contributions, they offer an ideal combination to boost Jaci's performance, making it less human-dependent and easier for human-robot to interact.

        \label{chap:5_jaci_sensors}
\end{figure}

It is also important to analyse Jaci's sensor kit concerning our contributions, i.e., is it necessary to make any changes in Jaci's hardware or software to make it compatible with our systems? The short answer is no, and we explain why. Jaci has a 2D lidar, which is used by the Gmapping SLAM system to build a 2D grid map $\bs{m}$. This type of map is the same used throughout the works presented in this thesis, highlighting the harmony between current Jaci's mapping system and this thesis contributions. Besides, Jaci also has one RGB camera pointing on each of its sides, which could be used to read the door labels, similar to our setup shown in Figure~\ref{fig:robotSetup}. Lastly, there are two RGB-D cameras attached to Jaci, pointing forward. These two visual sensors provide a 3D point cloud each, which helps estimate the object's position in relation to the robot, as we show in Figure~\ref{fig:system_overview}. Therefore, Jaci's configuration in its current version supports the deployment of our systems, and no change in the hardware of Jaci is required.

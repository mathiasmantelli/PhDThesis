\chapter{Introduction}
The first decades of research in Mobile Robotics, from the beginning until 2004, handled the challenges of connecting efficiency and data association. They introduced probabilistic formulations to path planning, exploration, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and many other areas. Some of the approaches from these areas are still popular nowadays, such as RaoBlackwellised Particle Filters and Extended Kalman Filters. The majority of them were based on ultrasonic or lidar sensors, as they were the most popular and robust sensors at the time. Consequently, the outcome maps were mostly 2D grid ones, in which the cells represented the free, occupied (obstacles), and unknown regions~\cite{Cesar2016Simultaneous}. 

After building a solid foundation for many problems with probabilistic approaches, the research community took a forward step. They concentrated on improving the properties of the already proposed and new approaches like observability, convergence, and consistency~\cite{Cesar2016Simultaneous}.
Simultaneously in this period (2004-2015), visual sensors have been in the spotlight as an alternative to gain information about the environment—their considerable improvement regarding the data quality and variety (e.g., depth images, point clouds, stereo images) aided their increasing employment. In fact, building 2D and 3D maps from the environment with a visual sensor resulted in a new term, Visual SLAM~\cite{Salas2014Dense}. 

Mobile robotics have enjoyed formidable advantages in performing tasks that only expect robots to navigate free spaces and avoid obstacles. Moving items from point A to point B or vacuuming free spaces are examples of robotics tasks with satisfactory solutions. However, the same level of success does not apply so far to many other high-level tasks that robots are dealing with nowadays. Since mobile robotics shifted its focus from factory floors and assembly lines to everyday living spaces, robots are demanded to perform human-like tasks in different scenarios that are not necessarily as strict and configured as the industrial world~\cite{Aydemir2012Exploiting}. We believe that one of the reasons for robots not prospering as much in high-level tasks is relying only on purely geometric maps and having limited perceptions that do not allow going beyond basic geometry representations to obtain a high-level understanding of the environment.  Therefore, the robots are deprived of processing the environmental data to infer or estimate extra valuable knowledge useful in various tasks. We then claim that when building autonomous robots, the high-level information inferred from the sensor readings (semantic information) has to be heavily exploited to complement the robot's perception.


The association of semantic information (or concepts) to geometric entities in the map is called semantic mapping, one of the newest topics the researchers have explored. It enhances the robot's autonomy and robustness in many ways, besides facilitating some high-level tasks~\cite{Cesar2016Simultaneous}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:zoox_semantic} is an image from Zoox's autonomous car, and it illustrates the advantage of using semantic information in robotics tasks. The car would probably map this scene with its geometric perception as four obstacles in its front, and two are closer than the other two. With a different perception based on semantic information, the car associates the concept of ``person'' to the three people and ``vehicle'' to the truck within the scene. Most importantly, it estimates that one person is distracted using his phone, and another is holding a stop sign. Combining the detection of a walking person and a phone allows the car to estimate the semantic information that this person is likely distracted. Hence, the car should drive itself even more carefully. This whole process is natural for human drivers, but the same can not be said about robots.

As semantic information is more like a specific knowledge inferred from the robot's surroundings than a specific type of data from a sensor reading, several questions need to be answered before using it in a robotic task. We see the following as noteworthy challenges: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deciding on what type of semantic information is possible to infer or estimate from the robot's surroundings that is relevant to the task
	\item How to perform the inferring or estimate the semantic information
	\item How to use the semantic information to improve the robot's performance
\end{itemize}

The first point is frequently discussed in its geometric version, as semantic information is relatively new in the literature. Briefly, for the context of a robotic task, what information is not explicitly in the environment but could be inferred or estimated to improve the robot's performance? This demands a deep understanding of the task and the general environment characteristics where the robot operates. An inspiration for answering this point is to consider how humans reason under the same circumstance and solve such a task, and how we process the environment's information to accomplish the task efficiently. 

Second, depending on the needed semantic information, it may be necessary to use methods based on machine learning to estimate it. For example, training a deep learning model for estimating terrain traversability for an outdoor ground robot may provide a suitable result. However,  besides the training requirement, the solution's quality depends on the training data, and this approach does not scale well. Probabilistic-based estimations appear as a second option, as it does not require a large set of data for training, and is compatible with a wide range of different models.

The third and last point, the proper use of the inferred semantic information in the robot's system, is crucial for successful task completion. As the robot gains more information from the environment, it is important to keep updating the estimations, and it is even better if the estimations become more robust over time. 

The exploitation of semantic information in robotics is an idea that has recently gained attention from researchers, and thus, most of the challenging problems are still unsolved. A simple way of pushing the limits further and exploring these problems is to study the advantages of semantic information in different areas. We have chosen a task with a high difficulty level that can benefit from semantic information, object search (OS) in indoor and unknown environments, a yet unsolved problem in robotics. 

In OS tasks, the robot's goal is to find a target object in the environment with a visual sensor. Usually, the environment is unknown to the robot, and the data it uses for searching are gathered with its own sensors. Since we are complementing the robot's perception with semantic information models for different OS tasks, the extra knowledge from the environment inferred by the robot has to aid the OS searching by reducing the search space. The robot plans a search strategy that estimates the most promising regions to contain the target object. 

%The first years of research in the field of Mobile Robotics saw the introduction of many probabilistic formulations for SLAM, path planning,  
%-At the beginning, Robotics was interested in estimating the obstacle's positions and the free space in the environment (Robotics has started with robots operating in assembly lines in factories, and now it is shifting to everyday living spaces)

%-However, this field has evolved and expanded the varieties of places the robots operate
%-By operating in more different environment and developing many tasks, researchers started including many sensors to the robots in order to make it more capable of acquiring data
%-However, that is not necessary if we can process the sensor readings and estimate more information besides the raw data

%Robotics has been changing its focus from factory floors to everyday living spaces, such as offices, houses, hospitals, airports, and etc~\cite{Aydemir2012Exploiting}.

\textbf{	Summary and Individual contribution:} This paper is on how to search a target object in unknown and dynamic environments efficiently. As opposed to other OS works that consider the objects' position static and ignore the human-object interaction, the idea presented in this work is to incorporate a person's routine and habits in the search strategy. This work aimed to model the semantic information of how objects are moved over time within an environment and use the inferred information to reduce the searching space. This idea came from observing how the objects are placed over time and that every person has their own singularities in terms of object placement.
The contribution of the author of this thesis is in modeling the semantic information as part of the search strategy and in building a heat map with the inferred data. 

	\item MANTELLI, M. et al. Semantic active visual search system based on text information for large and unknown environments. \textit{Journal of intelligent \& robotic systems}, Springer, v. 101, n. 2, p. 1–23, 2021.\\
\textbf{	Summary and Individual contribution:} In this work, we have argued that texts have a great potential for providing search clues and are often found in man-made environments. This idea came from the human behavior when searching for a someone's office in an unknown building, and how the door labels are used for estimating whether the current corridor is promising for finding the target office. The search strategy relies on the patterns of door labels in indoor scenarios and it reasons over them to estimate which corridor is more promising for achieving the goal.

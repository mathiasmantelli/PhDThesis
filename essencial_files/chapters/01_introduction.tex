\chapter{Introduction}
Robots can be grouped into different classes depending on their function and the workplace they are designed for~\cite{Kumar2005Industrial, ISO2012Robots, Haidegger2013Applied}. Among all the classes of robots, 
%there are two major ones, called \textit{industrial} and \textit{service}~\cite{UN2003World, De2011Domestic, Chiang2020Impacts, Garcia2020Service, Chen2021Human}. The first class, Industrial robots (IRs), are automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulators programmable in three or more axes, according to the Robotic Industries Association (RIA)~\cite{ANSI2012American}. They can be mobile or fixed in place platforms for industrial automation applications. Traditionally, such robots are designed for factories, where they are deployed for different application categories such as palletizing~\cite{Moura2018Application}, painting~\cite{Asadi2018Pictobot}, welding~\cite{Yao2019Light}, assembly~\cite{Kyrarini2019Robot}, and general handling tasks~\cite{Van2004Online, Hagele2016Industrial}. To meet the requirements for this set of applications, IRs have a wide variety of designs regarding payload capacity, workspace volume, and the number of robot axes~\cite{Hagele2016Industrial}. 
%Differently, the second class, 
service robots (SRs), are robots that work semi or completely autonomously to perform useful services, excluding manufacturing operations~\cite{ISO2012Robots}. The SRs come in all different designs, as they may or may not be equipped with an arm structure, and even though most of them are mobile, they can also be fixed in place~\cite{Garcia2020Service}. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) divides SRs into two subclasses based on their usability: \textit{professional} and \textit{personal}/\textit{domestic} service robots~\cite{Litzenberger2018Service}. Some examples of the professional service robots (PSRs) are defence robots~\cite{Martinic2014Proliferation}, farmer-assistants~\cite{Vakilian2017Farmer}, medical~\cite{Abubakar2020Arna}, and logistic~\cite{Thamrongaphichartkul2020Framework}. Examples of domestic service robots (DSRs) include but are not limited to vacuum cleaners~\cite{Forlizzi2006Service}, lawn-mowers~\cite{Borinato2017Auto}, food and beverage waiters~\cite{Wan2020Waiter}, and elderly assistants~\cite{Hersh2015Overcoming}. The market for SRs has been regularly rising, and it is no surprise that there is an expectation that it will grow even further in the next few years~\citep{De2011Domestic, Chiang2020Impacts}. The decreasing cost of hardware components (processors, motor drivers, and sensors), the increasing energy density and lower cost of batteries, and the threats caused by outbreaks such as COVID-19 drive this expansion~\cite{Chiang2020Impacts}.
 

%The industrial robots are the largest commercial application of robotics technology today, as they were the motivation for the development of the foundations for robot motion planning and control~\cite{Hagele2016Industrial}.

%\section{Scope}
According to the Population Division (PD) of the United Nations, in 2015, there were 901 million people aged 60 or over, representing 12\% of the global population~\cite{Population2015World}. Besides, the PD projects that by 2030, the number of older adults in the world will reach 1.4 billion and 2.1 billion by 2050. Several policies to tackle the problems of population ageing have been proposed by several countries, including, for example, facilities for the elderly~\cite{Lin2018Qualitative, Seddigh2020Comparative}. However, placing elderly people in facilities for retirement or even in nursing homes may cause some problems, such as physically, emotionally, and psychologically dependencies~\cite{Theurer2015Need}. Additionally, some elderly do not voluntarily stay at nursing homes, preferring to spend their remaining years at their home where they have a more positive self-image than those who live in the nursing homes~\cite{Kok2015Costs, Lin2018Qualitative}. The increasing number of older people living at home supports the need for DSRs to automate processes and tasks that may be tedious, inconvenient, or even challenging for older people~\cite{Paulius2019Survey, Torresen2020Special}. In general, these sorts of robots can contribute to practical tasks for humans as robot assistants or robot companions, such as watching older adults concerning emergencies, reminding them to take their medicines, and searching, picking, and placing objects~\cite{Sprute2017Ambient, Torresen2018Robot, Paulius2019Survey}. 

Additionally, while some of the main motivations for deploying SRs have been elderly assistance and productivity improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought a more critical purpose for them~\cite{Chiang2020Impacts}. PSRs can be deployed to perform a series of applications to provide contactless services, ensuring humans can practice social distancing~\cite{Seidita2021Robots}. Besides disinfecting indoor environments~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}, PSRs also have the potential to support the hospitality industry~\cite{Rosete2020Service}, and deliver medications and food~\cite{Lee2009Snackbot, Yang2020Combating}. The use of SRs in logistic applications is relevant during such unusual scenarios. Some national organisations from the United States identified logistics as one of the broad areas where robotics can make a difference during outbreaks~\cite{Seidita2021Robots}.

In many example applications that we listed above, it is likely that SRs have to perform some searching tasks. Simple examples would be DSRs searching and picking objects for elderly with mobility restrictions and PSRs delivering packages to a specific spot in an unknown environment. Similar to humans in the context of object searching tasks, SRs should also not rely on the assumption that the object (or regions of interest) they are searching for is already within their field of view (FoV)~\cite{Sjoo2012Topological}. Hence, they have to find the target object in large-scale environments based on primarily their visual sensors, known as object search (OS) problem~\cite{Aydemir2013Active}. However, how does an SR find the target object that is not initially within its FoV? One way to address this problem is to make the SR perform a brute-force OS, in which it visits the whole environment following a predefined search route. Even though this strategy seems a straightforward solution, it does not efficiently solve the problem~\cite{Rasouli2020Attention}. The SR will eventually find it as long as the target object is within the environment. However, the searching process may be time-consuming due to the long distances travelled by the robot. Another more efficient solution is to consider a search strategy that incorporates information from both the environment and the target object, to improve the searching performance. For example, such information could be the shape of the room for the environment (e.g. recognise a kitchen and then search for a plate) ~\cite{Aydemir2011Object}, and the colour or class for the target object~\cite{Rasouli2020Attention}. The search strategy is one of the most critical parts of an OS approach, as it directly impacts the efficiency of an OS system~\cite{Aydemir2013Active}. Therefore, it must be robust and effective regardless of the environment the SR is performing the search.

The research community has proposed valuable works related to the OS problem~\cite{Ekvall2007Object,Sjoo2009Object,Sjoo2012Topological,Aydemir2013Active,Rasouli2020Attention}. The problem is proven to be NP-Complete~\cite{Tsotsos1992Onthe,Ye2001AComplexity}, which means that the optimal search solution can be computed by approximation~\cite{Sjoo2012Topological}, minimising the search cost as much as possible. In the case of SR performing OS tasks, such approximation could be computed with the aid of strong cues provided by the semantics of both the environment and other objects in the SR's surroundings~\cite{Sjoo2012Topological}. Semantics can be regarded as the high-level information inferred (or ``perceived'') from the environment, including but not limited to names and categories of different objects, rooms and locations~\cite{Vasudevan2007Cognitive, Sjoo2012Topological, Liu2016Extracting}. Similarly, semantic maps encode not just the geometric and topological description of the environment but also its semantic interpretation, providing a friendly way for robots to communicate with humans~\cite{Liu2016Extracting}. Then, when the SR's system processes the robot's sensor readings to infer further knowledge about the surroundings, it increases the level of abstraction of the environment over time \cite{Barber2018Mobile}. The use of both semantic information and map in robotic applications enhances the robot's autonomy and robustness, besides facilitating some challenging tasks~\cite{Cesar2016Simultaneous}.

\section{Objective}

The objectives of this thesis are the followings
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{exploit the organisation of both the environment and objects to infer semantic search cues to address the OS problem}: we aim to demonstrate that organisational semantic information may help in the OS problem, providing a way to estimate which regions are more likely to contain the target object than others;
	\item \textit{infer organisational semantic information from numbers recognized from door signs}: we argue that the arrangement of the numbers from door signs follow a certain pattern (and rules). Understanding how the numbers are arranged makes possible to estimate how promising a certain corridor is, and then, decide whether the search should continue in the current region or not. We proposed a Number-based Semantic OS system to test this argument;
	\item \textit{infer organisational semantic information from changes of semi-dynamic objects}: we defend that objects are mainly moved by humans according to their daily routines and habits. It means that there are high chances that objects are moved in a particular pattern throughout a period of time, suggesting a repetition from time to time. Estimating such a pattern from human-object interaction may be useful for the OS problem, to estimate which places a target object may be in a given time of the day. We proposed a Long-term Semantic OS system to verify this idea;
	\item \textit{perform a coarse-to-fine OS search in indoor environments}: we aim to propose a larger OS system that makes possible to a SR find a target room, and interect with the object within it. By combining the proposed OS systems we end up with a coarse-to-fine OS sytem, which first searches for the room by its number, and later looks for a target object.
\end{itemize}


We claim that, in general, our society is not randomly organised, and there are several patterns and rules we follow every day. It is no surprise that humans can improve their efficiency while performing daily tasks, like OS, if the environment is merely logically organised. Thus, they can save energy and time during such tasks. For example, most cities have their own rules for numbering the properties, although there is no universal rule for that. The habitants can study it to understand the local numbering pattern. Thus, they can estimate where a particular unknown building is in the city, even if they have never been there. On the contrary, when there are no written rules to specify the organisation of the environment, humans can understand them just by observing the environment for a while. Inspired by human behaviour in OS tasks, we are interested in making the SRs take advantage of the organisation of environments to improve their performance in the OS task.

We consider that the organisational semantic information could be inferred from the environment through the SR's sensor readings, and it could be used to help SRs in search tasks. Such semantic information is helpful to OS systems because it could be used as high-level search cues. Then, with a semantic OS system, the SR would not need to search the whole environment to find the target object. The human reasoning process relies on several sorts of high-level search cues during searches, like labels and signs or the acknowledgment that other people may interact with the environment. In our daily life, we read signs, symbols, and labels to evaluate which direction we should go to find a specific room in an unknown environment. Another example would be someone who first checks whether the family's car is at home to then search for the car key. In particular, we focus on the organisational semantic information inferred from the organisation of both static and dynamic environments, like the labels and signs in the first example or the acknowledgement that other people may move objects.

%High-level robotics tasks demand the robots to read the environment similarly to humans, which reason over many characteristics of the room or objects and not only over the size of the free or occupied areas. The robot's geometric perception, i.e., raw sensor readings that generate standard geometric maps, is not descriptive and informative enough for providing such improvement demanded by the high-level tasks. This limitation does not mean that geometric maps are useless or irrelevant these days. On the contrary, they are still helpful and significant for the robot's safety navigation or path planning. However, there is a demand for complementing and extending the robot's geometric perception with meaningful knowledge from the environment. We then argument that the high-level information inferred from the sensor readings, also called semantic information, may be heavily exploited to complement the robot's perception when building autonomous robots.



\section{Contributions of this Thesis}

This thesis presents results \cite{Mantelli2021Semantic, Mantelli2022Semantic} showing that semantic information inferred from the organisation of the environment can help SRs in the OS problem. Specially, we show that the use of organisational semantic information as search cues in the search strategy of OS systems can make the SR save resources by not visiting the whole environment. Besides, we show that the proper use of semantic information can improve the SRs' perception to perform high-level tasks, bringing them closer to humans. We also present a discussion on how our contributions could be adapted and deployed to Jaci~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}. It is a recently released autonomous sanitiser SR that aims to aid both the fight against COVID-19 and hospital infections due to bacterias and fungus contaminations.

The first contribution of this thesis is a semantic system that performs the OS concerning the room organisation~\cite{Mantelli2021Semantic}. It aims to find a specific room in an unknown environment based on the organisation of door labels. Although humans heavily rely on texts, characters, and symbols for accomplishing several tasks, the use of numbers from text labels as a data source is not very popular in robotics. Despite the low interest by the research community, we argue that numbers detected from text labels have a great potential for providing search clues and are often found in man-made environments. This idea came from human behaviour when searching for someone's office in an unknown building. More specifically, we are interested in investigating how the numbers from door labels in corridors could be used to estimate whether a corridor is promising for finding the target office. The search strategy relies on the arrangement of door labels in indoor scenarios, and then it estimates which corridor is more promising for achieving the goal. It is important to highlight that even though our OS system is looking for a specific number, it is still looking for an object. That is because the number is recognized from a door sign, which is associated to a door, the object. Therefore, by saying that our OS sytem is searching for a number from a sign, what we really mean is that the goal is to find the door, the object, associated to the specific sign.

The scenario of our first contribution is considered static. The door signs arrangement do not change very often, as well as the position or amount of doors within a building. Hence, the parts of the environment that our system is relying on are static. If an SR has to perform object manipulation tasks in the room it has just found, it will probably have to search for the objects. However, in contrast to doors, objects inside a room are more likely to have their positions changed by someone, resulting in a more dynamic scenario. Hence, such a robot should perform an OS in a dynamic environment, and that is the context of our next contribution.

Our second contribution is a long-term semantic system that searches for a target object in dynamic unknown environments~\cite{Mantelli2022Semantic}. It assumes that some objects within the environment are not always static, i.e., that the organisation of the environment changes over time and is associated with people's activities. %people move them around over time. 
In this way, its goal is to incorporate a person's routine and habits into the search strategy and then make search estimations. This work aimed to model the semantic information of how objects are organised over time within an environment. Then, it uses this information to avoid making the SRs search for the target object in not promising regions. This idea came from observing how the objects are placed over time and that every person has their own singularities in terms of object placement.
%The contribution of the author of this thesis is in modeling the semantic information as part of the search strategy and in building a heat map with the inferred data. 

Lastly, we finish the contributions of this thesis with a discussion about the possibility of deploying our OS systems in the SR Jaci~\cite{Mantelli2022Autonomous}. This robot was build aiming help the fight against COVID-19 and hospital contamination in general. It is equipped with a set of UV lights and it autonomously disinfect indoor environments. However, it presents some limitations that could be overcomed by our systems. We present our ideas on how this deployment could be done, along with the possible boost in efficiency that our systems may provide to Jaci.

%============================================ OLD VERSION

\section{Old version}
The first decades of research in Mobile Robotics, from the beginning until 2004, handled the challenges of connecting efficiency and data association. They introduced probabilistic formulations to path planning, exploration, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and many other areas. Some of the approaches from these areas are still popular nowadays, such as RaoBlackwellised Particle Filters and Extended Kalman Filters. The majority of them were based on ultrasonic or LiDAR sensors, as these were the most popular and robust sensors at the time. Consequently, the outcome maps were mostly 2D grid ones, in which the cells represented the free, occupied (obstacles), and unknown regions~\cite{Cesar2016Simultaneous}. 

After building a solid foundation for many problems with probabilistic approaches, the research community took a forward step. They concentrated on improving the properties of the already proposed and new approaches like observability, convergence, and consistency~\cite{Cesar2016Simultaneous}.
Simultaneously in this period (2004-2015), visual sensors have been in the spotlight as an alternative to gain information about the environment. Their considerable improvement in data quality and variety (e.g., depth images, point clouds, stereo images) aided their increasing employment. In fact, building 2D and 3D maps with a visual sensor resulted in a new term, Visual SLAM~\cite{Salas2014Dense}. 

Mobile robotics have enjoyed formidable advantages in performing tasks that only expect robots to navigate through free spaces and avoid obstacles. Moving items from point A to point B or vacuuming free spaces are examples of robotics tasks with satisfactory solutions. However, the same level of success does not apply so far to many other high-level tasks that robots are supposed to dealing with nowadays. Since mobile robotics shifted its focus from factory floors and assembly lines to everyday living spaces, robots are demanded to perform human-like tasks in different scenarios that are not necessarily as strict, neat, and organized as the industrial world~\cite{Aydemir2012Exploiting}. Relying only on purely geometric maps, like 2D or 3D maps, and geometric perceptions, such as raw sensor readings, do not allow the mobile robotics going beyond basic representations, which restricts the robot to obtain a high-level understanding of the environment.  %We believe that one of the reasons for robots not prospering as much in high-level tasks is relying only on purely geometric maps and having limited perceptions that do not allow going beyond basic geometry representations to obtain a high-level understanding of the environment.  
The robots are deprived of processing the environmental data to infer or estimate extra valuable knowledge useful in various tasks. This might be the reason for robots not prosper as much in high-level tasks.

As aforementioned,

high-level robotics tasks demand the robots to read the environment similarly to humans, which reason over many characteristics of the room or objects and not only over the size of the free or occupied areas. The robot's geometric perception, i.e., raw sensor readings that generate standard geometric maps, is not descriptive and informative enough for providing such improvement demanded by the high-level tasks. This limitation does not mean that geometric maps are useless or irrelevant these days. On the contrary, they are still helpful and significant for the robot's safety navigation or path planning. However, there is a demand for complementing and extending the robot's geometric perception with meaningful knowledge from the environment. We then argument that the high-level information inferred from the sensor readings, also called semantic information, may be heavily exploited to complement the robot's perception when building autonomous robots.

The association of semantic information (or concepts) to geometric entities in the map is called semantic mapping, one of the newest topics the researchers have explored. It enhances the robot's autonomy and robustness in many ways, besides facilitating some challenging tasks~\cite{Cesar2016Simultaneous}. Autonomous cars are a great example of a robotic application that requires a human-like understanding of the environment. Figure~\ref{fig:waymo_point_cloud} depicts a point cloud from the Waymo's autonomous car while it is driving itself in the road. The raw point cloud does not differentiate the obstacles around the car since it only indicates where they are and which regions are free. If the car relies only on this point cloud, it can move by the road avoiding obstacles, but it is far from behaving like a proper driver following all traffic rules. Its geometric perception does not specify, for example, which obstacles are static (trees, curbs, or traffic plates) or dynamic (pedestrians, cyclists, or cars), which is vital for everyone's safety. However, with the aid of semantic information, the car's perception goes beyond just detecting objects such as traffic signs, cars, and people, Figure~\ref{fig:waymo_pedestrian_crossing_cars}. The car understands which traffic signs are open or closed by the color of their lights, where the cars are intended to go, and the type of the cars (regular or police), Figure~\ref{fig:waymo_pedestrian_crossing_cars_traffic_light_paths}. Human drivers naturally and quickly understand the scene in Figure~\ref{fig:waymo_clean_environment}, but the same can not be said about robots.

\section{Hypothesis and Goals}

We hypothesize that semantic information associated with the spatial and temporal organization of the environment bridge the gap limiting mobile robotics from improving towards high-level tasks. Our idea is that the way environments are organized and how they change over time provides information that can be inferred by the robot's system, which is more informative than only the LiDAR, sonar, or camera sensors reading. As semantic information is more like a specific knowledge for each task and inferred from the robot's surroundings than a generic type of data from a sensor reading, several questions must be answered before using it as part of the solution for a robotic task. We see the following as noteworthy challenges\footnotetext{Waymo \ang{360} Experience: A Fully Autonomous Driving Journey. youtube.com/watch?v= B8R148hFxPw}: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deciding on which type of semantic information is  relevant to the task and if it is possible to infer and associate to the robot’s surroundings;
	\item How to perform the inference or estimation of the semantic information;
	\item How to use semantic information to improve the robot's performance in a particular task.
\end{itemize}

Since semantic information is relatively new in the literature, the first point is frequently discussed considering a geometric perspective, without estimations, instead of a semantic one. For example, an autonomous vacuum cleaner relies on a 2D grid map to clean the free space. Hence, the raw readings from a 2D LiDAR sensor are enough for the robot to build the grid map and perform its task. On the contrary, the semantic perspective for any robotic task would be: which is the information that is not explicitly available in the environment but could be inferred or estimated to improve the robot's performance? To answer this question is necessary to deeply understand the task and the general environment characteristics where the robot operates. An inspiration for answering this point is to consider how humans reason under the same circumstance and solve such a task, and how they process the environment's information to accomplish the task efficiently.

Second, depending on the needed semantic information, it may be necessary to use methods based on machine learning to estimate it. For example, training a deep learning model for estimating terrain traversability for an outdoor ground robot may provide a suitable result. However,  besides the training requirement, the quality of the solution depends on the training data, and this approach does not scale well. Probabilistic-based estimations appear as a second option, as it does not require a large set of data for training, and accepts a wide range of different models.

The third and last point, the proper use of the inferred semantic information in the robot's system, is crucial for successful task completion. As the robot gains more information from the environment, it is important to keep updating the estimations, and it is even better if the estimations become more robust over time. 

The exploitation of semantic information in robotics is an idea that has recently gained attention from researchers, and thus, most of the challenging problems are still unsolved. A simple way of pushing the limits further and investigate these problems is to study the advantages of semantic information in different areas. In this thesis, we have chosen a task with a high difficulty level that can benefit from semantic information: OS in indoor and unknown environments, a yet unsolved problem in robotics. 

In OS tasks, the robot's goal is to find a target object in the environment with a visual sensor. Usually, the environment is unknown to the robot, and the data it uses for searching are gathered with its own sensors. Since we are complementing the robot's perception with semantic information models for different OS tasks, the extra knowledge from the environment inferred by the robot has to aid the OS searching by reducing the search space. The robot plans a search strategy that estimates the most promising regions to contain the target object. This thesis exploits the improvements in OS tasks by the use of semantic information inferred from two different data sources disregarded by the research community: text and dynamic obstacles. 

%The first years of research in the field of Mobile Robotics saw the introduction of many probabilistic formulations for SLAM, path planning,  
%-At the beginning, Robotics was interested in estimating the obstacle's positions and the free space in the environment (Robotics has started with robots operating in assembly lines in factories, and now it is shifting to everyday living spaces)
%
%
%
%-However, this field has evolved and expanded the varieties of places the robots operate
%-By operating in more different environment and developing many tasks, researchers started including many sensors to the robots in order to make it more capable of acquiring data
%-However, that is not necessary if we can process the sensor readings and estimate more information besides the raw data
%
%Robotics has been changing its focus from factory floors to everyday living spaces, such as offices, houses, hospitals, airports, and etc~\cite{Aydemir2012Exploiting}.

\section{Outline}
The outline of this thesis is as follows. First, in Chapter~\ref{chap:2_theoretical_background}, we introduce a background on the main problems in mobile robotics, as well as the most popular approaches that deal with each problem. Besides, it also presents the general concepts of the OS problem, which is used throughout this thesis along with the basic concepts of mobile robotics. In Chapter~\ref{chap:3_text_os_system}, we provide our first semantic OS system that is based on text as the main source of semantic information. Next, in Chapter~\ref{chap:4_temporal_os_system}, we discuss our second semantic OS system, which is the one that aims to understand how the objects within the environment are moved through a period of time, to make predictions about their future positions. Lastly, in Chapter~\ref{chap:5_discussion_thesis_progress}, we conclude this thesis proposal by discussing the current contributions and draw the future directions for this PhD work.

\chapter{Discussion on thesis progress}
\label{chap:5_discussion_thesis_progress}
In this thesis proposal, we have investigated the usage of semantic information in the context of OS problems. Our focus is on expanding and improving the robots' perception to perform high-level tasks in everyday living spaces. The majority of the proposed solutions to the OS problems depend on geometric information only, such as the object's 3D format or color, or require a preparation step, like informing which room is more likely to contain which object. The disadvantages of such proposals are that they are limited to the raw data read by the sensors and are not easy to deploy due to the preparation step they need before operating. Our approaches go beyond the geometric information and just the sensor readings, inferring semantic information that complements the robot's perception and enhances its performance in OS tasks. 

We proposed two OS systems based on semantic information inferred from two sources hardly explored in the mobile robotics field, text and dynamism. In the first system, we exploited the text of door labels, which were numbers, to find a target door in a large and unknown environment. 
This strategy is inspired by how humans behave under the same circumstances, i.e., looking for a door label in an unknown environment. Besides comparing each detected door label with the target one to check whether they are equal, humans also reason over the sequence of the door labels to estimate if the current corridor is promising to bring them to the target door. The search strategy of our first system combines semantic information (the parity and growth properties of the numbers) and geometric information (the corridor's orientation and the distance between the robot and the promising regions) to estimate which corridor of the building is more favorable. In case the robot is in a corridor that becomes less likely to contain the target door as the robot moves through it, the OS system guides the robot towards another one. Since the environment is entirely unknown to the system and no map is provided beforehand, it is doubtful that the robot will take the optimum path until the target door label while searching. Hence, more than guiding the robot straight towards the target's position, our OS system estimates when the current corridor is hopeless, and the robot should go elsewhere. The experiments in simulation and the physical world attest to that behavior from our semantic OS system, in which it always accomplishes the OS task. 

The second OS system aims to explore another source of information that promises to be helpful but neglected by the research community, the dynamic agents in the environment. The search strategy of this system also works in a way that mimics humans, because it assumes that objects are movable in real life, and it tries to understand how they move to estimate their future position. The semantic part of this strategy processes the data the system gathers over a while and calculates the target object's position based on its history of positions. As the estimations of this system are computed based on the collected data from the same environment, it allows our system to adapt to the person's routine and habits that interact with the objects. Hence, even though our system is generic and can be deployed in any environment, it adapts to the local singularities. Besides, the results of this system suggest that the more constant and repetitive the routine is, the more confident are the estimations. However, as also shown by the results, our system finds the target object even when the object's placement has not a pattern. 

\section{Ongoing and Future Work}

We are focusing our efforts on extending our last semantic OS system to understand better the humans' routine, which is ideal for service robots that interact with people for long periods. In a typical scenario, a person does not move an object without reason, i.e., humans do not randomly interact with objects to change their positions. Usually, there is a purpose behind a change in the object's position. We can associate this reason with an activity carried out by a person, such as taking a cup of coffee to the desk in the working area after a break. If we consider a person as the target object, as we did in one of our previous experiments, another example would be a person that moves within a house just when it is needed, as we tend to be inactive whenever possible~\cite{Lieberman2015Exercise}. The sequence of activities carried out by a person, also known as routine (or habits), has different patterns depending on the period of time is considered. There are the activities that are executed daily, whereas others are weekly or even monthly.  

Back to our temporal, semantic Os system, imagine a scenario where a person takes their backpack to work, which means it is not within the house during working hours, except for the weekend. In this context, if the person requests our system to find the backpack at any working hour, it would probably estimate that the object is not in the house, even during the weekends. This confusion is because our semantic OS system computes its estimations based on the hours of the day, and the weekday concept does not exist, i.e., all weekdays are equal as if the person's routine was the same throughout the week. However, as we argued, this assumption does not hold true, and in some cases, the robot may not find the target object as efficiently as it would with this new concept. After incorporating the weekday concept, we believe that our semantic OS system will have a more refined understanding of the placement of the objects, and by consequence, will be able to be more accurate in its estimations. In summary, the more our system understands how the objects are moved through a period of time, the more efficient the semantic OS system becomes. 

Lastly, due to the pandemic situation and the recommendations from the health organizations, we have not been able to perform experiments with the physical robot. We understand that such experiments are important to this research, and including their results in this thesis would be beneficial. Hence, we aim to deploy our algorithm to a robot and carry out several experiments as soon as we can access the Phi Robotics Research Lab at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. 


%Our semantic, temporal OS system aims to incorporate the person's routine, memorizing the past object's presence information to estimate where it will be in the future. So far, we rely only on the time of the day, but we understand that a person's routine may change depending on the weekday. The HH106 dataset presented a pattern in the human's activities, and it is possible to infer other semantic information based on the weekdays, hence improving the efficiency of our system. As future work, we aim to incorporate the days of the week into our OS system, which is another semantic information helpful in understanding the objects' position changes. Then, the OS system would estimate the most promising region for finding a target object based on both the request hour and weekday for a given request search. Despite demanding more data to start searching, we believe adding this semantic information would make the system more robust and adjustable to a person. Lastly, we were not allowed to conduct experiments with physical robots in our research lab due to the pandemic. When possible, we aim to test our OS system in a real scenario to evaluate its performance. 

\section{Thesis Schedule}

Since 2017, when this research work on this PhD study started, two works have been developed, and one more is for the near future. The schedule for the developed and future activities is presented in Table~\ref{chp05b_tab:activities}. The first year we focused on fulfilling most of the requirements from the PhD program, which includes the courses and the qualifying exam. The following year our focus changed to studying the OS problem and the mobile robotics problems necessary to solve it, i.e., exploration, mapping, and localization. For the next year and a half, we have developed our first semantic OS system that relies on text to infer the semantic concepts of parity and growth from door label numbers. In this last year and a half, we have developed our second OS system, based on dynamic agents.
